# TempMonitor

This project contains the code + instructions for a temperature monitoring system. It is based on a number of temperature sensors (k-type thermocouples) connected to an Arduino Mega board. The sensors are placed in a number of locations and thry constantly send real-time temperature data to a computer via Wifi (UDP). A dedicated GUI is designed to control the measurement, monitor the temperatures, and export the data to csv for further offline analysis.

This project was originally made as part of my PhD work. It was designed to test the cooling system for the electronic readout boards placed on the sTGC detector, which is part of the Muon-Spectrometer in the ATLAS experiment @ LHC, CERN.  

### Hardware

The temperature monitoring system contains four main components:
1. Arduino Mega 2560 controller
1. MAX 6673 k-type thermocouples
1. ESP 2866 Wifi micro-chip
1. 5.0V/3.3V Level-Shifter

A sketch illustrating how to connect the components is available in [/doc/FullSetup.jpg](https://github.com/gkoren/TempMonitor/blob/master/doc/FullSetup.jpg)

Eventually we designed a specail board that can be placed on top of the Arduino controller with the other componnents connected to it:

### Software

The code for running the monitoring system can be generally split into two main parts. One that activates the measurements via the Arduino controller, and one that activates and control the GUI (Python+Qt4)  
Arduino has great documentation, and if there are any parts I left out you can look for info in their web page: https://www.arduino.cc/ or simply google the issue â€“ there are usually answers there.

#### Step 1 : Arduino code

Before going into specific instructions for this project, you'll need to download and install the Arduion IDE which allows to upload code onto the Arduino. Once the code is uploaded on the Arduino it should run in the background regardless of the GUI.

In the "/Arduino" folder there are 3 subfolders: 2 containing the code files (one for serial communication and one for wifi communication via UDP),
and another folder with necessary libraries (don't need to do anything with these files, just have them saved). Note: this documenation contains instructions only for monitoring via Wifi communication.

1. **Connecting the Arduino to a Wifi network:**
    1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer USB port and open the file "Arduino/ESP_dialog/ESP_dialog.ino". This script will allow to communicate and gove commands directly to the Wifi chip.  
    Upload the script to the Arduino by clicking 'Upload' button (top left) and then wait to receivethe 'Done Uploading' message (bottom left)    
              
        ![Readme1](/doc/images/Readme/1.png)  
        
          
    1. Click on the 'Serial Monitor' button (top right) to type commands to the board. Make sure that the settings in the bottom are set like in the picture. Type `AT` in the command line and then press 'Enter/Send'. Wait to receive the 'OK' mesaage back on the screen.  
          
        ![Readme3](/doc/images/Readme/3.png)  
    
    1. Type the following commands:
    * `AT+RST` (Resets the Wifi chip)
    * `AT+CWLAP` (Prints a list of available networks). 
        * Make sure the desired network (same one your computer is connected to) appears in the list.
    * `AT+CWJAP="<network_name>","<password>"` (connects the Wifi chip to the network)
    
    After sending these commands wait to see the message: 'Wifi Connected' followed by 'Wifi Got IP'
                
    ![Readme4](/doc/images/Readme/4.png)  
    
1. **Sending and reading data:**
    1. Now we want to tell the Arduino to read the temperature data and send it to the computer. To do so open the file "/Arduino/Read_Temperature_Wifi/Read_Temperature_Wifi.ino".
    1. Before uploading the script to the Arduino, we first need to type in the IP address of the computer. In the line that reads `#define HOST_NAME XX.XX.XX.XX` replace the IP address with that of your computer (you **don't** need to edit the "HOST_PORT")
    1. After the correct IP adress is updated, save the file and upload the code to the Arduino board (top left)
